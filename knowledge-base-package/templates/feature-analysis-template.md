# SMT/CEPI Feature Analysis Template - New Features/Enhancements

> **CRITICAL: This is the EXACT format that must be used for ALL SMT/CEPI feature analysis**
> 
> **Usage**: This template MUST be followed precisely for every new feature/enhancement analysis
> 
> **Reference**: Based on user requirements and development team needs

---

## ⚠️ Analysis Limitations
[CONDITIONAL - Only show if applicable:]
- **Warning:** No code diff link found in ticket - analysis may be incomplete and test cases may not cover all implementation details

---

## 🚀 Feature Analysis

**What is being delivered?**  
[Clear description of the new feature/enhancement from user perspective. Focus on what the user can now do that they couldn't before.]

**Business Value:** [Why this feature matters to the business/users - ROI, efficiency gains, customer satisfaction]

**Target Users:** [Who will use this feature - specific user roles, customer segments, internal teams]

---

## 💻 Code Implementation Analysis

[If no code diff link: "**Note:** Since no code diff link was found, detailed code implementation analysis could not be performed."]

**New Components Added:**
- [Component 1]: [Purpose and functionality]
- [Component 2]: [Purpose and functionality]

**Modified Components:**
- [Component 1]: [What changed and why]
- [Component 2]: [What changed and why]

**Integration Points:** [How this feature integrates with existing systems]

**In simple terms:** [Non-technical explanation of what was built]

---

## 🎯 Architecture & Design Analysis

**New Architecture Patterns:** [Any new design patterns introduced]

**Data Flow:** [How data moves through the new feature]

**Dependencies:** [External dependencies or services used]

---

## 📊 Business Impact

**New Capabilities:**
✅ [What users can now do]
✅ [Business process improvements]
✅ [Efficiency gains]

**Potential Risks:**
⚠️ [Areas to monitor post-release]
⚠️ [Potential impact on existing workflows]

---

## 🧪 QA Testing Strategy

[If no code diff link: "**Note:** Since no code diff link was available, test cases may not cover all implementation details."]

### **P0 Test Cases (Core Feature Validation)**
- [Verify primary feature functionality]
- [Test main user workflows]
- [Validate core business logic]
- [Check data accuracy and integrity]

### **P1 Test Cases (Integration & Impact Areas)**
- [Test integration with existing features]
- [Verify backward compatibility]
- [Check performance under load]
- [Validate error handling scenarios]

### **Edge Cases & Scenarios**
- [Boundary value testing]
- [Negative scenarios]
- [Concurrent user scenarios]
- [Data validation edge cases]

### **Regression Testing Areas**
- [Existing features that might be affected]
- [Critical user journeys to revalidate]
- [Performance benchmarks to maintain]
